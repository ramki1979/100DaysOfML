# 30DaysOfML
I am taking up the challenge to Learn Machine Learning at least 3 hours a everyday!!

## Day 1 : August 27 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Completed Python Programming round-up on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)

**Summary** : 
    I work on different languages in my day job & python is not one, I worked on it few years back but didn't remember much.

    I concentrated more on List, Dictionary, Comprehensions, Imports.

    Trying to get the concepts rather than syntax!!.
